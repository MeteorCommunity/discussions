Meteor core community discussions
=================================

This repository tracks discussions about *application development* in Meteor. The Meteor core team is doing a fantastic job, but their focus is on core development, rather than real-world application development. We aim to provide the core devs with distilled input from the perspective of experienced Meteor application developers.

Contributions, members, ideas and opinions are welcome!

Let us coordinate efforts creating new packages, pull requests, patterns or guidelines for Meteor.

We could use this repo as base/topics for a monthly package developer/core Hangout discussion.

## WARNING!
I will sometimes remove comments and integrate them into the issue description - it's an attempt to keep the discussions clean whilst having a brief summary of the discussion.

You are most welcome to protest if you feel violated :)

## Labels

Labels reflect what parts of Meteor the discussion pertins to:
* [Package system](https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/labels/Package%20system)
* [Utilities](https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/labels/utilities)
* [Isobuild](https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/labels/isobuild)

Labels track the status of a discussion:
* Discussion - We are trying to define the actual problem to solve
* Potential Pull Request - A solution is near

If solved the issue is closed

-

## Debate

In a discussion we don't actually have to agree on things! __Core__ developers and __App__ developers face different problems.
We just have to figure out how we can write better apps that are still performant/scalable - There will often be a natural conflict of interest :)

The issue will be marked:
* Community agrees
* Community doesn't agree
* MDG agrees
* MDG doesn't agree
